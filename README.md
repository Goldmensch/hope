# Hope

Hope is a Minecraft server reimplementation using modern Java features such as
virtual threads.

## Goals

The goals of this project are:

- high performance
- small memory footprint
- fast startup time

Please note that this project does not aim to be a 100% accurate vanilla reimplementation.
It's more of an experiment to investigate the new possibilities that modern Java brings us.
